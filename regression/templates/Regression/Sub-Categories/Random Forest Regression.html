							<h1>About Random Forest Regression</h1>
							<div class="description-underline"></div>
							<p>Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes or mean/average prediction of the individual trees.</p>

							<div class="description-underline"></div>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Banking Sector</strong></li>
									The banking sector consists of most users. There are many loyal customers and also fraud customers. To determine whether the customer is a loyal or fraud, Random forest analysis comes in. With the help of a random forest algorithm in machine learning, we can easily determine whether the customer is fraud or loyal. A system uses a set of a random algorithm which identifies the fraud transactions by a series of the pattern.
								<li><strong>Medicines</strong></li>
									 Medicines needs a complex combination of specific chemicals. Thus, to identify the great combination in the medicines, Random forest can be used. With the help of machine learning algorithm, it has become easier to detect and predict the drug sensitivity of a medicine. Also, it helps to identify the patient’s disease by analyzing the patient’s medical record.
								<li><strong>Stock Market</strong></li>
									 Machine learning also plays role in the stock market analysis. When you want to know the behavior of the stock market, with the help of Random forest algorithm, the behavior of the stock market can be analyzed. Also, it can show the expected loss or profit which can be produced while purchasing a particular stock.
